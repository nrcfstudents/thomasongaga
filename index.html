<h3>Description of the games</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Football</dt>
<dd>Soccer, known as football outside of North America, is a team sport played with a round ball on a rectangular field, typically measuring 100 to 110 meters long and 64 to 75 meters wide. The game is played between two teams, each with 11 players, including a goalkeeper. The primary objective of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net.</dd>
<dt>Rugby</dt>
<dd>Rugby is a contact sport that involves two teams competing to carry, pass, and kick a ball in order to score points by grounding the ball in the opposition's goal area (called a try zone) or kicking it through goalposts. There are two main types of rugby: rugby union and rugby league, both sharing similar basic principles but differing in rules and style of play.</dd>
<dt>Badminton</dt>	
<dd>Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport that is typically played indoors, though it can also be played outdoors in recreational settings. The game is played with a shuttlecock (often called a "birdie") and a racquet. The objective is to score points by hitting the shuttlecock over a net and into the opponent's side of the court in such a way that it is difficult for them to return.</dd>
<dt>Basketball</dt>
<dd>Basketball is a fast-paced team sport in which two teams of five players each compete to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing teamâ€™s hoop (also called a basket), which is mounted 10 feet above the floor. The game is played on a rectangular court, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Basketball combines athleticism, strategy, teamwork, and skill in a dynamic, high-scoring game.</dd>
<dt>Handball</dt>
<dd>Handball is a fast-paced, team sport in which two teams of seven players (six outfield players and a goalkeeper) compete to score goals by throwing a small ball into the opponent's goal. The game is typically played indoors, but there are also outdoor variations. Handball combines elements of basketball, soccer, and water polo, involving dribbling, passing, and shooting with the hands while also requiring strong teamwork and strategy.</dd>
